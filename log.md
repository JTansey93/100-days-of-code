# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 6th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started by working on a command line exercise tracking app in Python

**Thoughts:** The hardest part was breaking down the logic of the problem I was tackling into something that made for good code. I need to improve planning out my applications and their features beforehand to improve the coding part of my application.

### Day 1: April 7th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the Mozilla Developer Network modules on HTML and CSS

**Thoughts:** My biggest difficulty when it comes to web development is not understanding the frontend/ui aspect of things, so hopefully improving my knowledge of HTML, CSS and eventually some vanilla javascript should radically improve my ability to build web pages, although I have some knowledge of these technologies, learning them from the beginning in a structured way seems appropriate.
